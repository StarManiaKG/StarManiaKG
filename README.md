#
amatuer game developer and coder, and by amatuer i mean i'm a minor lol
#
i can still code some things though (mainly lua and C, though i know more about the former than the latter)
#
I mainly use a windows for everything i do, and it can also efficiently emulate a Linux desktop too, so you know, equality :p
#
if you have any questions, which you probably will have most likely judging by my life choices, dm me on discord at StarManiaKG#4884, or my SRB2 Message Board account, which also goes by the same name.
