sans deltarune



amatuer game developer and coder
i can still code some things though (mainly lua and a bit of C)


I mainly use a chromebook for everything i do, and it works efficiently to use a linux desktop on, so yeah

if you have any questions, which you probably will have most likely, dm me on discord at StarManiaKG#4884
