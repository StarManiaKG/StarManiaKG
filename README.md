heheheha



amatuer game developer and coder, and by amatuer i mean i'm a minor lol

i can still code some things though (mainly lua and C, though i know more about the former than the latter)


I mainly use a chromebook for everything i do, and it works efficiently to use a linux desktop on, so yeah

if you have any questions, which you probably will have most likely judging by my life choices, dm me on discord at StarManiaKG#4884, or my SRB2 Message Board account, which also goes by the same name.
