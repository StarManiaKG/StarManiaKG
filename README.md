Self-Hired Game Developer
I typically code in Lua, SRB2Lua (BLua), and C.
I dabble in the worlds of C++, Python, and Verse, but I'm more experienced with Python.
#
I use both Windows and Linux, so horray for equality I guess :P
#
if you have any questions, which you probably will have most likely judging by my life choices, you can find me in a couple of places:
  - Discord, at StarManiaKG(#4884), or
  - The SRB2 Message Board, which goes by StarManiaKG
#
Take Care!
